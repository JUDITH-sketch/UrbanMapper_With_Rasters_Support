# Urban Mapper, its Branding & UX Design

Urban Mapper is a free and open-source project that values consistency in both its visual identity and user experience. This document presents the branding and user experience (UX) designs that guide the project's development and presentation.

## Branding

To maintain a consistent visual identity, all branding designs for Urban Mapper were created using Figma. These designs are available below for interactive visualization.
