## üöï Taxi Trip Analysis ‚Äì‚Äì In a Nutshell

This study maps **taxi pickups and dropoffs** in **Downtown Brooklyn** to **street segments and intersections** using `OSMNxMapping`. By integrating taxi trip data with OpenStreetMap street networks, we reveal spatial patterns of urban mobility and provide insights for smarter urban planning.

- **[1] Downtown_BK_Taxi_Trips_OSMNX_StepByStep.ipynb**  
  A step-by-step tutorial covering:
  - Loading taxi trip data from CSV.
  - Querying the Downtown Brooklyn street network.
  - Preprocessing data (imputing missing coordinates, filtering to a bounding box).
  - Mapping pickups and dropoffs to street nodes.
  - Enriching the network with pickup and dropoff counts.
  - Visualising results interactively (streets and intersections) and statically (intersections).

- **[2] Downtown_BK_Taxi_Trips_OSMNX_Pipeline.ipynb**  
  A streamlined `UrbanPipeline` automating:
  - Data loading and network creation.
  - Imputation and filtering.
  - Mapping and enriching with pickup/dropoff counts.
  - Interactive visualisation of streets and intersections‚Äîall in a concise workflow.

- **[3] Downtown_BK_Taxi_Trips_OSMNX_Advanced_Pipeline.ipynb**  
  An advanced `UrbanPipeline` extending the basic pipeline with:
  - Additional enrichment for average fare amount per street segment/intersection.
  - Interactive visualisation of pickup counts, dropoff counts, and average fares.

## ü•ê Getting Started

1. **Install OSMNxMapping**: Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/OSMNxMapping#installation).
2. **Prepare Data**: Ensure your taxi trip data (e.g., `taxi_trips.csv`) includes columns:
   - `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`
   - `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`
   - (Optional) `fare_amount` for advanced metrics.
3. **Run Notebooks**: Open the `/Study Cases` folder in Jupyter and start exploring!

## üõ£Ô∏è Why It Matters

Analysing taxi activity enables cities to:
- Pinpoint high-demand streets and intersections.
- Optimise traffic flow and ride-sharing efficiency.
- Inform infrastructure planning with mobility data.

Your insights could drive impactful urban solutions!

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / Future Work

- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigate pickup/dropoff trends by time of day or week.
- **Extended Metrics**: Add trip distance, passenger counts, or congestion indicators.
- **Scalability**: Adapt the pipeline for larger regions or datasets.

## Data Sources

- **[Yellow NYC Taxis 2015](https://arc.net/l/quote/pwljlsqk)**: Sample taxi trip data for NYC. We simply used a million sample from the original data for the sake of the example.
