## üöó Collision Analysis ‚Äì‚Äì In a Nutshell

This study maps **Downtown Brooklyn motor vehicle collisions** to **street intersections** using `OSMNxMapping`.  
To improve urban safety research, we link collision data to OpenStreetMap road networks to reveal hotspots and patterns.

- **[1] Downtown_BK_Collisions_OSMNX_StepByStep.ipynb**  
  A detailed, procedural implementation leveraging OSMNxMapping to ingest NYC DOT collision data from CSV, construct a drivable street network for Downtown Brooklyn via OSM queries, preprocess geospatial data (imputation via SimpleGeoImputer, spatial filtering with BoundingBoxFilter), map collisions to nearest intersections using node-based nearest-neighbor assignment, enrich the network with collision counts per node, and render an interactive Folium visualisation‚Äîideal for dissecting each computational stage.

- **[2] Downtown_BK_Collisions_OSMNX_Pipeline.ipynb**  
  A streamlined UrbanPipeline automating the collision mapping process described in [1] in ~10 lines‚Äîquery network, load, map, enrich, visualise‚Äîall in one go.

- **[3] Downtown_BK_Collisions_OSMNX_Advanced_Pipeline.ipynb**  
  An advanced pipeline compared to [2] exploring collision severity (more than one enriching process all-in-one). I.e. injuries, and fatalities.

Each notebook is modular and primed for customization‚Äîadapt them to your geospatial datasets with ease!

## ü•ê Getting Started

1. **Set Up OSMNxMapping**: Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/OSMNxMapping#installation) from the main repo.
2. **Dive into Notebooks**: Open the `/Study Cases` folder in Jupyter to start exploring collision data.
3. **Make It Yours**: Adapt the pipelines to analyse collisions (or other data) in your city/neighborhood of choice!

## üõ£Ô∏è Why It Matters

Collisions are a big deal in cities. This study:

- Spots high-risk intersections with precision.  
- Visualises trends in a snap with interactive maps.  
- Fuels smarter safety solutions for urban planners and communities.  

Your analysis could help save lives‚Äîone street at a time!

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / Future Work

- **Time Trends**: Map how collisions change by hour, day, or season. Further will be available when `UrbanMapper` sees the light of day.
- **Cause Analysis**: Link crashes to factors like road design or weather, maybe via `LLM` && `Causality` now that you have the "enriched" data üëÄ.
