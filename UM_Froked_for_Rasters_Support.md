## 📂 About This Repository

This directory is a copy of the UrbanMapper environment that enables running everything presented in my NYU internship project folder.

🔍 Note: This is specifically a copy of the VIDA UrbanMapper repository (https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/UrbanMapper) with the following modifications:

- In the `examples` folder: Only contains my custom notebooks 📓
- In `src/urban_mapper/modules/loader`: Added test files ✅
- In `src/urban_mapper/modules/loader/loaders`: Added all versions of my custom loaders 🔄

## 🚨 Important Note

By default, `raster_loader.py` contains loader v6. To run UrbanMapper with a different version X:
1. Copy the contents of `raster_loader_vX.py`
2. Paste into `raster_loader.py`

## 🛠️ Installation

UrbanMapper must be installed to use this fork (install in development mode to access local modifications). Installation instructions are available in the repository.
